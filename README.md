## Q1. A Time For Everything (12m)

1. When the micro:bit is switched on, the LEDs display a numeric value, X. (2m) 
2. Initially, X == 5. (2m)
3. Pressing A decrements X; pressing B increments X. (2m)
4. X is limited to the range 1 to 9 only; both 1 and 9 inclusive. (2m)
5. Pressing both buttons causes X to count down to zero, in approximately 1s intervals. (2m)
6. When X reaches 0, the display stays at 0. (2m)



## Q2. Itâ€™s the paradox that drives us all (3m)

1. When the micro:bit is in a vertical position, a single LED lights up (LED X), on any corner of the micro:bit display.
   1. When the micro:bit is rotated clockwise, the LEDs along the edges light up, starting from LED X, X+1, X+2, etc.
   2. When the micro:bit is rotated anti-clockwise, the lighted LEDs will be unlit, from X+2, X+1, etc. When one full circle has been made, the display clears. If the micro:bit continues to be rotated clockwise, LED X lights up again, and the pattern repeats. (1.5m)
2. When the micro:bit is in a horizontal position, a blinking LED lights up in the centre of the screen.
   1. By tilting the micro:bit, the blinking LED moves in the direction of tilt (in 4 directions only).
   2. The display initially shows a number 0.
      1. When the micro:bit is rotated clockwise, the number increments.
      2. When the micro:bit is rotated anti-clockwise, the number decrements.
      3. The number must remain in the range [0, 9].
   3. If the blinking LED hits any of the edges, the number is reset to 0. (1.5m)

## Design Considerations

Due to the limitations of the mbed compiler, it is not possible to include more than one source file before compilation. As such, all classes and types had to be defined within one source file.

### `Circular` and `CircularDirection`

The `Circular` class includes multiple helper functions specific to values that *wrap* around back to 0.

More importantly, it provides a way to determine circular rotation directions (clockwise, anti-clockwise) based on discrete points. Difficulty arises when data points overflow and wrap multiple times around the circular structure. There are two methods -- `compare` and `flow` -- that handle separate cases.

`CircularDirection` represents a clockwise, anti-clockwise, or indeterminate rotation.

### `Optional`

A simple wrapper class to better handle "nullable" data.

### `Buffer`

The `Buffer` class smoothens raw data over time based on the frequency of "changed" data points.

At every tick cycle, it gets raw data from a pointer to some method which produces that data. It then keeps track of the number of data points which represent a significant change, and only reports a change when there are enough data points.

This allows us to remove any spikes in the raw data due to noise, which is extremely prevalent in the micro:bit.
